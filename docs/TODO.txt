THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TO SAVE, WHEN AND WHERE. UPDATED NECESERY IN CHAT CLASSES 
SO FAR REGARDING SAVING AND ADDING MESSAGES OR USERS.

1. Go over every single class and make sure that every ctor can take in all of the props
this is the ground work for from_dict() methods, that are required in order to get instances from the db
and not only the dict of that instance.
2. Create the from_dict() method for each non-abstract class, so that if an object is being getted from the 
db by the end of the from_dict() sequence the object is fully recovered, nested objects and all


Create server and client for when users send eachother messages, the server is used to route the messages 
between the clients. NOTE FOR SELF: ASK HOW IP ECT IS USED
